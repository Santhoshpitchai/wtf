- Cannot be bypassed even with direct API access
- Most secure layer

### Layer 2: Application (Protected Routes)
- Prevents unauthorized page access
- Redirects users to appropriate pages
- Better user experience

### Layer 3: UI (Role-Based Menus)
- Hides unavailable features
- Reduces confusion
- Cleaner interface

### Layer 4: Forms (Auto-Assignment)
- Prevents PTs from assigning clients to others
- Automatically sets correct trainer_id
- Data integrity

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Admin Flow:
1. Sign up with "ADMIN" role
2. Login with "ADMIN" role
3. Verify all menu items visible
4. Create a PT account
5. Create clients and assign to different trainers
6. Access all pages without restrictions

### Test PT Flow:
1. Sign up with "PT" role
2. Login with "PT" role
3. Verify limited menu (no Trainers, PT Sales, Create PT)
4. Create a client (should auto-assign to you)
5. Try to access `/dashboard/trainers` (should redirect)
6. Verify you only see your own clients

### Test Data Isolation:
1. Create clients as Admin assigned to different PTs
2. Login as PT1 - should only see PT1's clients
3. Login as PT2 - should only see PT2's clients
4. Login as Admin - should see all clients
